# MDN Practice: Number Guessing Game #
## Example Instructions: ##

*I want you to create a simple guess-the-number type game where a player has ten (10) chances to correctly guess the number that is between 1 and 100. After each guess they will be told if they are right or wrong and whether the guess was too low or too high; previous guesses will be displayed for reference*

*The game ends once the player makes the correct guess or they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.*
